This respository contains the latest definitive bug fixed source code for examples from Mining the Social Web[1]. As of late October 2010, the book's content is nearly final and production at O'Reilly is commencing. A "final" electronic version of the book is expected to be available in January 2011, but you can grab the Rough Cut[2] online right now or read it in Safari[3].

More information will be added here as it becomes available.
